Immio
=====
With the demise of ompldr, I felt the need to find a new "image pastebin." I quickly discovered `imm.io <http://imm.io>`_, and discovered through their `API page <http://imm.io/api>`_ that it is fabulously simple to upload over the command line. This is extremely new software, and, at the beginning, will only upload an image and return its URL. Eventually, I hope to add a few other bells and whistles (along with a manpage and good documentation).

To-do
-----
*Sorted by level of importance*

# Have output formatting done natively in C (if possible)
# Add options (and relevant documentation) for managing images (not just uploading them)
# Print more helpful ``help``
# Add ``-v|--verbose`` flag to output more information about the image
